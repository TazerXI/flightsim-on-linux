# Navigraph Simlink

[Navigraph Simlink](https://navigraph.com/apps/connectivity/simlink) allows you to see your aircraft in real time on
[Navigraph's charts](https://charts.navigraph.com/). The charts are best accessed on a browser, as this does not require you to run it through Wine.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This software is only supported on Windows/Mac, even though this has been able
  to run on Linux, there is no guarantee that this will work later down the
  line. Do not expect support from Navigraph as this is not officially supported
  on Linux.

## Installation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Difficulty:** Medium
</Callout>

Make sure that you familiarise yourself with [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks) before beginning this tutorial.

You can download Navigraph Simlink from their website, or use this direct link
[here](https://download.navigraph.com/software/simlink/windows/Navigraph+Simlink.exe).

<Steps>

### Installing Navigraph Simlink

Run the installer in Protontricks. Once the installation completes, Navigraph Simlink will open, you should close this
and make sure it's completely closed, as it may just minimise to the system tray.

### Create a Desktop Entry

Logging in requires Simlink to be opened form the browser. The only way to register Simlink as a supported application
that can open from the browser is to create a
[Desktop Entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html).

Desktop Entries go into `~/.local/share/applications/`, but you can create multiple directories inside it to make it
easier to manage your custom Desktop Entries you have manually created. For example on my system, I store them under

```
~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Navigraph/
```

Now create a Desktop Entry inside there with a text editor of your choice. The name of the file is irrelevant as long
as it has the `.desktop` extension.

```desktop copy filename="Navigraph Simlink.desktop"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Navigraph Simlink
Exec=protontricks -c "wine C:/Program\\ Files/Navigraph/Simlink/NavigraphSimlink.exe %u" 1250410
Type=Application
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/navigraph-traffic-desktop;
Categories=Game;Simulation;
```

Then make sure to update the database for desktop entries by running this command in the terminal

```shell copy
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

You should now be able to find Navigraph Simlink in your Desktop Environment's application launcher. Launch it and now
you should be able to log in!
