# Navigraph Hub

[Navigraph Hub](https://navigraph.com/products/navigation-data) allows you to update your AIRAC data in the simulator
and for certain aircraft.

Unfortunately, this is the only way to update the AIRAC, as there is no drag and drop options like in X-Plane, nor are
there any manual installer for the simulator and addons.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This software is only supported on Windows, even though this has been able to
  run on Linux, there is no guarantee that this will work later down the line.
  Do not expect support from Navigraph as this is not officially supported on
  Linux.

## Installation

  **Difficulty:** Easy
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The new update for Navigraph Hub only works with [Proton-GE
  8](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom), if you are using a
  vanilla or older version of Proton-GE, this may not work and you may need to
  update it. Follow the [guide](/msfs#move-old-files-to-new-version) on updating
  Proton!
</Callout>

Make sure that you familiarise yourself with [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks) before beginning this tutorial.

You can download Navigraph Hub from their website, or use this direct link
[here](https://download.navigraph.com/software/navigraph/windows/Navigraph%20Hub.exe).

<Steps>

### Installing Navigraph Hub

Run the installer in Protontricks. Once the installation completes, Navigraph Hub should open and it should work as
normal.

### (Optional) Create a Desktop Entry

Creating [Desktop Entries](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)
used to be necessary, but not anymore. It is only useful if you want this in your Desktop Environment's application
launcher.

These files will go into `~/.local/share/applications/`, but you can create multiple directories inside it to make it
easier to manage your custom Desktop Entries you have manually created. For example on my system, I store them under

```
~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Navigraph/
```

Now create a Desktop Entry inside there with a text editor of your choice. The name of the file is irrelevant as long
as it has the `.desktop` extension.

```desktop copy filename="Navigraph Hub.desktop"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Navigraph Hub
Exec=protontricks -c "wine C:/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Programs/navigraph-hub/Navigraph\\ Hub.exe %u" 1250410
Type=Application
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/navigraph-desktop;
Categories=Game;Simulation;
```

Then make sure to update the database for desktop entries by running this command in the terminal

```shell copy
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

You should now be able to find Navigraph Hub in your Desktop Environment's application launcher.
