# VATSIM

[VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/) is a realistic online multiplayer network for all a variety of simulator.

This guide covers setting up a VATSIM client with [swift](https://swift-project.org/) (as vPilot does not run in Proton)
and model matching from [FSLiveTrafficLiveries](https://fslivetrafficliveries.com/).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  These software/addons are only supported on Windows for MSFS, even though this
  has been able to run on Linux, there is no guarantee that this will work later
  down the line. Do not expect support as this setup is not officially supported
  on Linux.

<Steps>

### Installing Model Matching

I use FSLTL for model matching. It should be a relatively simple install, only problem is that the FBW installer does not
work in Proton, so you will have to manually download and install the models. This does not cover installing the injector.

To download FSLTL, you should clone the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/FSLiveTrafficLiveries/base). You can
download this from GitHub directly `Code > Download Zip`, but it is faster to use git.

```shell copy
git clone git@github.com:FSLiveTrafficLiveries/base.git
```

Once you have cloned this, move the `fsltl-traffic-base` directory to your `Community` folder in MSFS. You can also delete
the leftovers from the cloned repository now.

### Installing swift

Download the Windows installer from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/swift-project/pilotclient/releases/latest)
and run the installer through [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks#terminal).

The configuration wizard should launch automatically.

Accept the terms.

Click on next in the `Data loading` page.

Click on skip in the `Copy models` and `Copy settings and caches` page.

In the `Simulator` page, under `Setup of each individual simulator`:

1. Simulator: FSX
2. Simulator directory: set the directory to `%appdata%/Microsoft Flight Simulator`
3. Model directories: `%appdata%/Microsoft Flight Simulator/Packages/Community` and ``%appdata%/Microsoft Flight Simulator/Packages/Official`

Then click next.

In the `First model set` page, make sure FSX is selected in `Simulator` and `Distributions`, then under `Models`:

1. Models: reload
2. Under `Distributions`, select `FSLTL`, and then back under `Models`, click create next to Model set.

Then your model should have been created, make sure to click on save, then click next.

Skip the XPlane setup (as this will only run for MSFS)

Configure your hotkeys, you'd at least need one for push to talk. Then click Finish.
