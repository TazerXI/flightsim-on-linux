# GSX

[GSX](https://www.fsdreamteam.com/products_gsxpro.html) is an addon for Flight Simulator that provides ground services
and other features to make the simulator feel more alive on the ground.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This addon is only supported on Windows, even though this has been able to run
  on Linux, there is no guarantee that this will work later down the line. Do
  not expect support from FSDT (even though Umberto was very kind to fix the
  installer to work in Proton) as GSX is not officially supported on Linux.

## Installation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Difficulty:** Medium
</Callout>

This addon comes with its own installer that requires quite a bit of tinkering to get working.

Make sure that you familiarise yourself with [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks) before beginning this tutorial.

<Steps>

### Create a symlink for a .NET file

If you do not create a symlink for `regasm.exe`, there will be an error that pops up once the FSDT Universal Installer
installation completes. This step may not be necessary
([forum post explaining this](https://www.fsdreamteam.com/forum/index.php/topic,30014.msg193939/topicseen.html#msg193939))
but I recommend doing this step as it may prevent problems down the line.

The file you will be creating a symlink for is a file included from Proton which is located in

```
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton 8.0/dist/lib/wine/i386-windows/regasm.exe
```

(**Proton versions vary, make sure the directory is for the Proton version that you use for your Flight Simulator**)

Which this file needs to be symlinked to

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/regasm.exe
```

(**Path to your `compdata` may vary, make sure to change these depending on your Flight Simulator installation**)

A simple command can be run to make a symlink for you (**edit the directories in the command based on the information
above**)

```shell copy
ln -s ~/.steam/root/steamapps/common/Proton\ 8.0/dist/lib/wine/i386-windows/regasm.exe ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/regasm.exe
```

Now when you run the installer, there should be no errors once the installation is finished. If there is, it's likely
that you can just ignore them.

### Run the FSDT Installer in Protontricks

Make sure to have the installer downloaded and then run it through either the Protontricks Launcher or the Terminal
(check out the [Protontricks guide](/msfs/protontricks) for more details).

Once the installation completes, the Universal Installer should pop up. Close it as we are going to update it in the
next step as there does not seem to be an easy way to check the version installed.

### Updating the FSDT Universal Installer

To update the installer, you will need to open up the Protontricks GUI from the terminal

```shell copy
protontricks 1250410 --gui
```

And then `Run explorer` ([more detailed guide on this](/msfs/protontricks#terminal)).

Then you will have to navigate to the `FSDT Installer` shortcut which is located on the Desktop inside of Proton.
The directory for this is

```
My Computer -> C:\users\Public\Desktop
```

And then run `FSDT Installer`.

Once this is finished installing, it should pop up with the Universal Installer.

### Installing GSX

Click on `Install` for GSX, enter your license key and let it install. This may take a while, and it will most likely
look like it will hang at certain points and do nothing, just make sure to give it some time whilst GSX is being
installed.

Once it has been installed, it will not show that it is linked to the simulator as there is an option to `Relink`. Do
not press this button as the installer will just freeze. Instead, just close the installer as the next step deals with
creating the symlinks that the installer was unable create.

### Creating Symlinks to the Simulator

As the symlinks have not been made in Flight Simulator's `Community` folder, you will need to do this manually.

This will need to be done for 2 folders that GSX created when it was installed: `fsdreamteam-gsx-pro` and
`fsdreamteam-gsx-world-of-jetways`.

Two commands can be run to create these symlinks. **You may need to edit these directories based on where you installed
Flight Simulator**, these commands assume Flight Simulator is installed in the default location on Steam.

```shell copy filename="fsdreamteam-gsx-pro"
ln -s ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Addon\ Manager/MSFS/fsdreamteam-gsx-pro ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft\ Flight\ Simulator/Packages/Community/fsdreamteam-gsx-pro
```

```shell copy filename="fsdreamteam-gsx-world-of-jetways"
ln -s ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Addon\ Manager/MSFS/fsdreamteam-gsx-world-of-jetways ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft\ Flight\ Simulator/Packages/Community/fsdreamteam-gsx-world-of-jetways
```

</Steps>

And now GSX should be installed into your simulator and should be able to run as normal!
