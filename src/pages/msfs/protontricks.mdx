# Protontricks

[Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks#readme) is a wrapper for running Winetricks commands, which is
designed for Proton. This makes running executables for Flight Simulator much easier.

## Installation

Installing Protontricks should be quite simple, as there are multiple methods of installing it depending on your
distribution. You can find the documentation for installing it on their GitHub repository
[here](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks#installation).

## Usage

### Protontricks Launcher

Some Desktop Environments will be able to run the file directly in Protontricks if you can right-click the installer
and open it with `Protontricks Launcher`

And then select `Microsoft Flight Simulator` as the Wine prefix

![Game Select](/protontricks/gameSelect.png)

### Terminal

If you do not have the option to run Protontricks Launcher, you'll have to manually run it in the terminal with

```
protontricks 1250410 --gui
```

Ignore all the warnings that will pop up, as this will not affect the installation.

Once the Winetricks window pops up, OK on `Select the default wineprefix`

Then select `Run explorer` and click OK

![](/protontricks/terminal2.png)

Which will pop up a window for Flight Simulator's Wine directory, where you'll need to navigate through Linux's
directory (with the drive that has `/`), where you can find the executable and run it.

### Uninstalling Applications

The easiest way to uninstall addons/applications would be to run Protontricks in the [terminal](#terminal) and instead
of selecting `Run explorer`, select `Run uninstaller`

![](/protontricks/uninstall1.png)

This will open up a window where you can uninstall other addons/applications you have installed for Flight Simulator
