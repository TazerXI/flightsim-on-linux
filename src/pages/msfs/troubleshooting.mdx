## Freezing on Accessibility Settings in the Loading Screen

The most likely reason for this freeze is due to the screen reader being enabled on this menu and as there is no
screen reader provided on Linux, this will result in Flight Simulator freezing.

To fix this issue, you will have to remove the screen reader config in the Flight Simulator directory, inside
`steamapps`.

The file that causes this problem is:

```
MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml
```

And you can rename it to remove this file. You can use the command below (**change directories to point to your
`steamapps` if Flight Simulator is not installed in the default location**)

```shell copy
mv ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml.bak
```
