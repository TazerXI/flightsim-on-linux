# Troubleshooting

This page is for general troubleshooting tips for Flight Simulator only, not for addon troubleshooting.

## Freezing on Accessibility Settings in the Loading Screen

The most likely reason for this freeze is due to the screen reader being enabled on this menu and as there is no
screen reader provided on Linux, this will result in Flight Simulator freezing.

To fix this issue, you will have to remove the screen reader config in the Flight Simulator directory, inside
`steamapps`.

The file that causes this problem is:

```
MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml
```

And you can rename it to remove this file. You can use the command below (**change directories to point to your
`steamapps` if Flight Simulator is not installed in the default location**)

```shell copy
mv ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/MicrosoftFlightSimulator/Packages/fs-base-ui/ScreenReader/ScreenReader.xml.bak
```

## Photogrammetry not working

You may see that the ground textures is using Bing data, and this could be a problem with how the latest versions
of Proton installs certain libraries that may still be missing.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to make a **backup** of your MSFS `compdata` if you do not know if
  changing Proton versions will delete that folder. If it does get deleted, you
  will have to reinstall MSFS, with the 100+GB download.
</Callout>

To fix this problem, change MSFS's Proton version to `Proton 6.3` and run the simulator once
(it may immediately launch and crash, this is fine, move on to the next step).

Once it has run once, you can change the Proton version back to the previous version that you were running on,
(in my case, Proton-GE 8), and you should see real world photogrammetry again (as long as it's turned on)!
