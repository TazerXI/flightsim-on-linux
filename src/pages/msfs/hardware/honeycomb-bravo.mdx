# Honeycomb Bravo

[Honeycomb Bravo](https://flyhoneycomb.com/products/bravo-throttle-quadrant) is a popular hardware throttle unit for many flight simulators.

It works natively on linux eg. on X-Plane. To make it recognizable by Wine a few tweaks are needed.

## Setup

<Steps>

### Ensure Honeycomb Bravo is recognized as a HID device

By default wine recognizes the Honeycomb Bravo throttle as an XBOX controller. To fix this a few changes to the registry of the Wine prefix are needed.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Editing the registry can break a Windows system and break your Wine prefix if something is done wrong.
  Use caution and read the instructions carefully.
</Callout>

#### Open the registry editor

```
protontricks 1250410 regedit
```

#### Create necessary registry entries

Locate the following registry key

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\winebus
```

Create the following DWORD values:

- Name: Enable SDL Value: 0
- Name: Map Controllers Value: 0

### (Optional) Correct already registered device

If you already started MSFS with the Honeycomb Bravo plugged in, it's likely been registered as an XBOX controller.

You can fix this by editing the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\WINEBUS`

#### Reset values of existing xinput entries to winehid

The entries regarding the Honeycomb Bravo contain the following device IDs (VID/PID) 294b and 1901
Inside those entries a few changes need to be made.

- Change the value of "Service" from `xinput` to `winehid`
- Change the value of "DeviceDesc" from `Wine XInput compatible device` to `Wine HID compatible device`
- Change "CompatibleIds" to only include `WINEBUS\WINE_COMP_HID`. 

</Steps>

You should now see your Honeycomb Throttle in the controller settings in MSFS and can map it to your liking.
