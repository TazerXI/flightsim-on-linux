# PMDG

PMDG has a few study level aircraft for Flight Simulator, most notably the 737s.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  PMDG's aircraft are only supported on Windows, even though this has been able
  to run on Linux, there is no guarantee that this will work later down the
  line. Do not expect support from PMDG as their aircraft are not officially
  supported on Linux.
</Callout>

Their aircraft can be bought on:

- [PMDG Website](https://pmdg.com/msfs/)
- Flight Simulator store (not tested on Linux so far)

## Installation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Difficulty:** Easy
</Callout>

This installation guide is for installing aircraft bought directly from the PMDG website. This guide has only tested
the 737-800 bought directly from their website, installations may vary, but I would assume it would work the same for
other aircrafts.

<Steps>

### Run the installer

Download the installer and then run it normally via [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks).

Once the installer has completed, the PMDG Operations Center will open up and throw an error, click on `Quit` and make
sure it has been closed.

### Fix PMDG Operations Center

A config file needs to be edited for the PMDG Operations Center located here (**edit the directory based on where your
`compdata` for Flight Simulator is**):

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/PMDG/PMDG Operations Center/PMDG Operations Center.exe.config
```

Open that file in a text editor of your choice and delete these lines:

```xml
<System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
  <add key="DpiAwareness" value="PerMonitorV2" />
</System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
```

Now when you open the PMDG Operations Center, you should get a warning, which you can click `Continue` on. It should
work normally and you should be able to install liveries now.

### (Optional) Create a Desktop Entry for PMDG Operations Center

Creating a [desktop entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)
should make opening PMDG Operations Center easier as you will not have to find the location manually each time.

These files will go into `~/.local/share/applications/`, but you can create multiple directories inside it to make it
easier to manage your custom Desktop Entries that you manually created. For example on my system, I stored this entry
under

```
~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/PMDG/
```

Create a Desktop Entry inside a location specified above, with a text editor of your choice. The name of the file is
irrelevant as long as it has the `.desktop` extension.

```desktop copy filename="PMDG Operations Center.desktop"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=PMDG Operations Center
Exec=protontricks -c "wine C:/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/PMDG/PMDG\\ Operations\\ Center/PMDG\\ Operations\\ Center.exe" 1250410
Type=Application
StartupNotify=true
Categories=Game;Simulation;
```

Then make sure to update the database for desktop entries by running this command in the terminal

```shell copy
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

You should now be able to find PMDG Operations Center in your Desktop Environment's application launcher.

</Steps>

The aircraft and PMDG Operations Center should work on Linux now. Enjoy flying your aircraft in the simulator!
