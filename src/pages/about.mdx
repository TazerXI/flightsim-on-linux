# About

The goal for this website is to provide guides to get flight simulators up and running
on Linux, which helps avoid needing Windows just to play certain games.

This project has been developed by Anthony Berg (or as some of you may have known me
as smyalygames) as a fun side project to bring the joy of flight sims to everyone :D

Feel free to contribute to fixing/writing guides, as this is a free and open source
project :)

I also have no intentions of running any ads or creating any paywalls on this website
as I want to provide as much as possible for the community!
