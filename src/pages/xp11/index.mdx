# X-Plane 11

X-Plane 11 is a last generation simulator from Laminar Research. This simulator will run on Linux, as well as Mac and
Windows.

## Running X-Plane 11

This simulator should be able to run out of the box with minimal problems. There are two options when buying this
simulator:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  There is a newer version of X-Plane, X-Plane 12, keep in mind it may not be
  worth it to buy X-Plane 11 as it will most likely reach the end of its life
  with support from addon developers soon. This guide only has information for
  X-Plane 11 as I do not have access to X-Plane 12.

## Installing Addons

Installing a lot of addons for X-Plane is quite simple as this game runs natively on Linux. A lot of the installation
is the same as Windows.

### Installing Windows only Addons

The only way to install addons that will only work on the Windows version of X-Plane, you will need to run X-Plane
through Proton.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Using Proton will remove Vulkan support, running the game in OpenGL, which
  will lead to a performance loss and therefore is not recommended!
</Callout>

Most of these addons can be installed as usual with just a simple drag and drop into the X-Plane folder. However, some
developers use their own executable installers, like addons bought from X-Aviation.

These can be installed using Wine, where you will have to select the path to your X-Plane folder.
