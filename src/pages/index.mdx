# Welcome to Flight Sim on Linux

This is where you can find guides on getting certain simulators or addons working on Linux. This is just
a personal project of mine, and I hope that if you are using these guides, you'll be able to enjoy using
flight simulators without the need of being locked into Windows!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    These guides do not guarantee that simulators/addons will work. There will always be a risk buying a
    product as most developers do not support their products on Linux.
</Callout>

The simulators and addons here are limited by the amount of funds I have, and as I am a university student,
it means it will limit the amount of guides on this page. This is where you could contribute by writing a
guide, or potentially donate for certain addons to have guides written for them (which is not currently
set up).
